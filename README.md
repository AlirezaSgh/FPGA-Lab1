# FPGA-Lab1
Implementing a UART module, a FIR filter and its wrapper to use with UART.
It uses the Altera Cyclone II DE2 board's serial interface to communicate with PC and trade files. The design is tested on board for noise removal of a sound file. The final communications were done using a simple matlab script.
